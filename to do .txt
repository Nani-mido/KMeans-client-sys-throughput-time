put sub families in data frame.

calculate the avg time, avg usr , avg sys for each sub family.

scenario 1 all data           (KMeans, KMedoide, LSTM, HMMs)

scenario 2 req                (KMeans, KMedoide, LSTM, HMMs)

scenario 3 common cases       (KMeans, KMedoide, LSTM, HMMs)

scenario 4 uncommon case      (KMeans, KMedoide, LSTM, HMMs)
